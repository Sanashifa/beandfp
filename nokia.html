                <h1>Nokia 2.1 Brief Description</h1> 
                <p>Nokia 2.1 runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC. As Android Go OS is used on less powerful devices, it comes equipped with 1GB RAM and 8GB of internal storage that can also be expanded up to 128GB via microSD card. It features a 5.5-inch HD 16:9 display with a 720x1280 pixel resolution. The handset is backed by a 4000mAh battery that is touted to deliver a two-day battery life. In terms of optics, the phone is equipped with an 8MP rear camera that supports autofocus and on the front is a 5MP sensor. </p>
                <p>Nokia is usually swift when it comes to pushing software updates to its devices. It has been able to stick to its update schedule for most of its phones and it recently rolled out the Android Pie update for the Nokia 6 (2018) smartphone. Now, the company has announced that the Nokia 2.1 is also being updated with the latest Android 9 Pie update. However, the handset is an Android Go smartphone and it seems to be the first handset to be updated to Android 9 Pie (Go Edition). Alongside the new Android 9 Pie (V1.08C) update, the new patch will improve the system stability on the device and update its security patch to February 2019. 
                </p>
                <p>The Chief Product Office of HMD Global, Juho Sarvikas, made the announcement via Twitter. The new software update is expected to be rolling out in phases so, it can take some time before popping up on every Nokia 2.1 handset. One can force check for the update by heading over to their phoneâ€™s settings and checking for System Updates in the About Phone tab. The update will enable new notifications, system navigation and settings menu on the handset. We already know that Android 9 Pie (Go Edition) frees up to 500MB additional storage for a phone and is touted to reduce boot time. A dashboard will also be enabled that will allow tracking and monitoring data being consumed. </p>
