                <p>Apple has reportedly commenced commercial manufacturing its iPhone 6s in India, at its Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Wistron’s Bengaluru facility. The company was having a trial production run for the iPhone 6s since April and the device was chosen because of its sales potential, states a report by The Economic Times, citing two unnamed senior industry executives. If the report is to be believed, then the Apple iPhone 6s will also be exempted from any tax raises, similar to the IPhone SE. 
                </p>
                <p>Apple is also said to be considering expansion of local manufacturing and is speculated to start manufacturing older iPhone models in India like the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8 series of handsets. “The made-in-India iPhone 6s will be only sold in India like iPhone SE since it will take time to scale up capacity. In fact, Apple will continue with the import of iPhone 6s until capacity improves. Hence, there will be no price correction for the locally manufactured units. The made-in-India iPhone 6s model will hit the stores soon,” the executive told The Economic Times. </p>
